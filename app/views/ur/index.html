          <li>The highest earning weeks was noticed by some agents without the need for prompting.

          <li>We used radio options for Today, Yesterday, and Another date as we believe most claims would be processed within 2 days of receipt.</li>

        <li>The introduction of the MAP did also seem to create a need to know the 14th and 20th weeks for eligibility purposes.</li>
        <li>Agents didn&rsquo;t notice the Key Details bar.</li>
        <li>Date claim received didn&rsquo;t cause any issues, but it was highlighted that it&rsquo;s very unlikely that agents would be working on claims from today or yesterday, so they would always need to enter a different date.</li>
        <li>Employer name was highlighted as being needed. This has been heard in previous rounds of research. Currently this cannot be pulled through by the Finances team.</li>

          <li>We added a question to find out if the claimant has chosen a date when they would like their MA payments to start. Not every claimant provides this answer, so we needed a way to make it optional. If they have provided a preferred start date, the agent will be able to input it in the conditional reveal.</li>
          <li>To add more value to the blue banner, and reduce the number of tabs on the screen, we moved claimant details to the blue banner.</li>
          <li>We added a tag to reflect the status of the claim to the blue banner. We think it might also be useful to have tags for disallowed claims, and claims awaiting specific pieces of information â€“ we will explore what these might be through UR.</li>
